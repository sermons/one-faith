Then we will no longer be **infants**, <br/>
tossed back and forth by the waves,

and blown here and there <br/>
by every **wind of teaching**

and by the **cunning** and **craftiness** <br/>
of people in their **deceitful scheming**.

Instead, speaking the **truth in love**,

we will **grow** <br/>
to become in every respect

the **mature body** of him <br/>
who is the **head**, that is, Christ.

as each **part** does its work.
