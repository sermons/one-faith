## Ephesians 4:14 (NIV) (p.1/3)
Then we will no longer be **infants**, <br/>
tossed back and forth by the waves,

and blown here and there by every **wind of teaching**

and by the **cunning** and **craftiness** <br/>
of people in their **deceitful scheming**.

---
## Ephesians 4:15 (NIV) (p.2/3)
Instead, speaking the **truth in love**, <br/>
we will **grow** to become <br/>
in every respect the **mature body** <br/>
of him who is the **head**, that is, Christ.

---
## Ephesians 4:16 (NIV) (p.3/3)
From him the whole body, <br/>
**joined** and **held together** <br/>
by every **supporting ligament**,

**grows** and **builds** itself up in love, <br/>
as each **part** does its work.
