# What does it mean to be **mature**?

---
## Ephesians 4:14 (NIV) (p.1/3)
Then we will no longer be **infants**, <br/>
tossed back and forth by the waves,

and blown here and there by every **wind of teaching**

and by the **cunning** and **craftiness** <br/>
of people in their **deceitful scheming**.

---
## Ephesians 4:15 (NIV) (p.2/3)
Instead, speaking the **truth in love**, <br/>
we will **grow** to become <br/>
in every respect the **mature body** <br/>
of him who is the **head**, that is, Christ.

---
## Ephesians 4:16 (NIV) (p.3/3)
From him the whole body, <br/>
**joined** and **held together** <br/>
by every **supporting ligament**,

**grows** and **builds** itself up in love, <br/>
as each **part** does its work.

## Mark 8:34,36 (NASB)
If anyone wishes to **come after Me**, <br/>
he must **deny himself**, <br/>
and **take up his cross** and **follow Me**.

[...] For what does it **profit** a man <br/>
to **gain the whole world**, and **forfeit his soul**?

>>>
+ **maturity**: knowing lots? **capable**?
+ Humbly walk with God as a **child**
